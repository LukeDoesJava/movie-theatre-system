## **movie-theatre-system**
A movie theatre mock system that is able to store account information, movie seatings, manages ticket purchasing, account balance, and utilizes socket programming to conenct a server script.
Project was made in 2019 as my grade 11 final project, and was meant to showcase a months worth of researching socket programming and my progress with learning Java.
At this was one of my first fully scoped projects, it is pretty rudement, and entirely terminal based.
# **Download and Use**
To try this system for yourself, follow the steps below:
  1. Download all the files from [movieTheater](https://github.com/LukeDoesJava/movie-theatre-system/tree/main/movieTheater)
  2. First, run serverCLS.java, text will appear in the terminal letting you know that the server is waiting for a connection.
  3. Now run the movieTheatreCLS.java script, the server will notify the server terminal that a connection has been made, and now the movieTheatreCLS script can be used.
  4. Create an account on the login screen, or refer to clientInformation.txt for account information to use for the login
Now you are free to navigate all of this system's features, any actions like reserving a seat, spending points, or creating an account will alter their respective .txt files in order to store changes.
Feel free to go into these files and change the data yourself, but note that removing these scripts, or heavily altering any movie seat txt file will reduce their functionality.
